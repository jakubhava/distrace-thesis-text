\chapter*{Attachment 2: List of Examples}
The source code of the thesis contains several examples. They can be run manually by first compiling the sources and then starting using the provided scripts. The examples are also available in the provided Docker machine. This docker machine contains all compile and run-time dependencies for the tool to be able to run and examples can be run on this machine as well.

The list of available examples:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{DependencyInstrumentation} \newline
	This example just demonstrates the basic instrumentation functionality on dependent classes. It does not have any output do the user interface.
	\item \textbf{H2OSumMRTask} \newline
	This larger example demonstrates the tool on the H\textsubscript{2}O  machine learning platform. The cluster of three H\textsubscript{2}O nodes is started and a simple map-reduce task is executed within this cluster. The internals of map-reduce task are monitored and the associated spans are shown in the Zipkin user interface.
	\item \textbf{SingleJVMCallback} \newline
	This example demonstrates how the Distrace tool can be used to instrument and monitor the callbacks. This example is using a single JVM with multiple threads.
	\item \textbf{SingleJVMThread} \newline
	This example shows how threads can be instrumented and monitored. This example is running on a single JVM with multiple threads.
\end{enumerate}
