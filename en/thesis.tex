% Abstract (recommended length around 80-200 words; this is not a copy of your thesis assignment!)
\def\Abstract{%
The main goal of this thesis is to create a monitoring platform and library which can be used to monitor distributed Java-based applications. This work is based on Google Dapper and shares a concept called "Span" with it. Spans encapsulate set of calls among multiple communicating hosts and in order to be able to capture them without the need of changing the original application, instrumentation techniques are highly used in the thesis. The thesis consists of multiple parts: the native agent and instrumentation library and server. The users of this platform need to extend the instrumentation library and specify the points in their application's code where new spans should be created and closed. In order to achieve high performance and affect the running application least as possible, the instrumentation server is used for instrumenting the code. All classes marked for instrumentation are sent to the server which alters the byte code and caches the changed byte-code for the future instrumentation requests from other nodes.
